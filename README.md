# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification
What is a Brain Tumor?
A brain tumor is a collection or mass of abnormal cells in the brain. Since the skull is a rigid structure, any growth inside this confined space can cause serious complications. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). As they grow, they can increase pressure inside the skull, potentially leading to brain damage or even becoming life-threatening.

## Why Is This Important?
Early detection and classification of brain tumors is a critical area of research in medical imaging. Accurate and timely diagnosis enables healthcare professionals to choose the most effective treatment methods, ultimately saving lives.

## Project Overview: Brain Tumor Diagnosis Using Deep Learning
This project applies deep learning techniques to improve brain tumor diagnosis using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

When a user inputs an MRI image, the CNN model detects whether a tumor is present and classifies it into one of the following categories:

Glioma

Meningioma

Pituitary tumor

No tumor

This approach enables fast, reliable, and automated support for clinical decision-making.
